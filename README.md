# Gaming User Overview Dashboard </br>

> ### Limitations
> I tried to create a simple version of an overview dashboard. I acknowledge that the conversion rate of the paid users are not realistic since usually more than 90% of free-to-play & in-app-purchase game players are free players. However this is the limitation for this dataset since the all of the data are generated using ChatGPT. </br></br>

## Introduction & Purpose
The dashboard features the overview of the game product by countries (US, KR, JP). The problem to solve: how we should target users from each of the countries in order to increase revenue? </br></br>

## Facts
1. The US has the most users playing the game and the highest conversion rate to paid user.
2. Japan has the smallest users playing and the smallest conversion rate. However, once converted, the paid users spend the most per user.
3. Korean users are easily converted compare to Japan, but they tend to stick to lower cost packages.
4. When looking at the product categories, Japanese users tend to purchase packages that are critical to game play (battlepass, booster). Whereas Korean users are more sensitive to items per price. The US users tend to spend on skins and currencies.

## Suggestion
Here are some suggestions to increase revenue per countries. </br>
1. Performing AB tests for pop-ups: for example, we can use different pop-up ads for each of the countries. For users in Japan, show them battlepass or booster packages in between the game play. For Korean users, the pop-up should show some cost-efficient starter-packs.
2. Or, we can test whether restructuring the store page for each country works or not. For example, when a Japanese user goes into the store in the app, depending on the users' country, the store would show battlepass and booster packages on top with the other packages following as the person scrolls down. </br></br>


### Things to Consider
Here we considered the user to be either Korean or American depending on the country code. In real life the users often use different languages that are not matching to the country. For instance, an American user might play the game in English while the coutry location is Korea. A Korean user might be playig in Korean while in the US. So sometimes the language mode of the game often represents the users' cultural background/tendency better than the country information.
