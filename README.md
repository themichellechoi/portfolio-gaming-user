# Gaming User Overview Dashboard

> ### All of the data are artificially generated.
> I tried to create a simple version of an overview dashboard. I acknowledge that the conversion rate of the paid users are not realistic since usually more than 90% of free-to-play & in-app-purchase game players are free players. However this is the limitation for this dataset since the data is generated using ChatGPT.

## Introduction & Purpose
The dashboard features the overview of the game product by countries (US, KR, JP). The problem to solve: how we should target users from each of the countries in order to increase revenue?

## Facts
1. The US has the most users playing the game and the highest conversion rate to paid user.
2. Japan has the smallest users playing and the smallest conversion rate. However, once converted, the paid users spend the most per user.
3. Korean users are easily converted compare to Japan, but they tend to stick to lower cost packages.
4. When looking at the product categories, Japanese users tend to purchase packages that are critical to game play (battlepass, booster). Whereas Korean users are more sensitive to items per price. The US users tend to spend on skins and currencies.
